# OpenRPG
A handy dandy helper program for playing D&amp;D! (This is just a concept and will need to be expanded on)

# Building
Currently we require `cmake` (at least v3.0) and `make`

Create a build directory `mkdir build &&  cd build`
Run cmake `cmake ..`
run make `make`
run make install `make install`

This will give you an executable OpenRPG file, as well as create executables for each module located in `build/bin/modules/`
