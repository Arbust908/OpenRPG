# Contributing to the project

So you want to know how you can help?? You've come to the right place!
Below you will find many ways you can help.

## Contributing Issues

### Before Submitting an Issue
First, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. If there is an issue add your comments to this issue.

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request, do not file combo issues.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. Therefore:

* Provide reproducible steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you would have expected.
* Description of what you expect to happen
* Animated GIFs
* Code that demonstrates the issue
* Version of OpenRPG
* Errors printed to the command line

## Contributing Fixes
First and foremost check the TODO's to see what needs to be done.
Once you're ready to start programming see the Programming Standards section.

I have broken the goals and needs by the "Difficulty" of the task. Beginner tasks
will be more specific, such as working on a certain function or method. Intermediate tasks
will be a little broader, such as creating a specific class or utility. Advanced
tasks will be major milestones that need to be completed. And should only be attempted
by someone that understand the language.

### TODO's

#### BEGINNER
None at the moment. To be updated.

#### INTERMEDIATE
None at the moment. To be updated.

#### ADVANCED
None at the moment. To be updated.


These TODO's are very broad and this list will grow as new ideas are brought to the table and more people begin to contribute.

### Pull Request

For something to be considered for merging into master it must be 
submitted as a Pull Request to development first. All Pull Requests 
will be given at least 24 hours before being merged into the 
development branch. Pull requests may take longer to be merged if more 
needs to change. On every Monday the development branch will have a pull 
request made to be merged into the master repository. This pull request 
will sit for one week to be reviewed until it is merged in on Sunday. 
The weekly pull request may be delayed if more changes need to be made.
